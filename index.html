    	History provides ample evidence for the crucial importance of large-scale cooperation. Victory
almost invariably went to those who cooperated better – not only in struggles between Homo sapiens
and other animals, but also in conflicts between different human groups. Thus Rome conquered
Greece not because the Romans had larger brains or better toolmaking techniques, but because they
were able to cooperate more effectively. Throughout history, disciplined armies easily routed
disorganised hordes, and unified elites dominated the disorderly masses. In 1914, for example, 3
million Russian noblemen, officials and business people lorded it over 180 million peasants and
workers. The Russian elite knew how to cooperate in defence of its common interests, whereas the
180 million commoners were incapable of effective mobilisation. Indeed, much of the elite’s efforts
focused on ensuring that the 180 million people at the bottom would never learn to cooperate.
In order to mount a revolution, numbers are never enough. Revolutions are usually made by small
networks of agitators rather than by the masses. If you want to launch a revolution, don’t ask yourself,
‘How many people support my ideas?’ Instead, ask yourself, ‘How many of my supporters are
capable of effective collaboration?’ The Russian Revolution finally erupted not when 180 million
peasants rose against the tsar, but rather when a handful of communists placed themselves at the right
place at the right time. In 1917, at a time when the Russian upper and middle classes numbered at
least 3 million people, the Communist Party had just 23,000 members.19 The communists nevertheless
gained control of the vast Russian Empire because they organised themselves well

    	When authority in
Russia slipped from the decrepit hands of the tsar and the equally shaky hands of Kerensky’s
provisional government, the communists seized it with alacrity, gripping the reins of power like a
bulldog locking its jaws on a bone.
The communists didn’t release their grip until the late 1980s. Effective organisation kept them in
power for eight long decades, and they eventually fell due to defective organisation. On 21 December
1989 Nicolae Ceauşescu, the communist dictator of Romania, organised a mass demonstration of
support in the centre of Bucharest. Over the previous months the Soviet Union had withdrawn its
support from the eastern European communist regimes, the Berlin Wall had fallen, and revolutions
had swept Poland, East Germany, Hungary, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia. Ceauşescu, who had ruled
Romania since 1965, believed he could withstand the tsunami, even though riots against his rule had
erupted in the Romanian city of Timişoara on 17 December. As one of his counter-measures,
Ceauşescu arranged a massive rally in Bucharest to prove to Romanians and the rest of the world that
the majority of the populace still loved him – or at least feared him. The creaking party apparatus
mobilised 80,000 people to fill the city’s central square, and citizens throughout Romania were
instructed to stop all their activities and tune in on their radios and televisions.

    	To the cheering of the seemingly enthusiastic crowd, Ceauşescu mounted the balcony overlooking
the square, as he had done scores of times in previous decades. Flanked by his wife Elena, leading
party officials and a bevy of bodyguards, Ceauşescu began delivering one of his trademark dreary
speeches. For eight minutes he praised the glories of Romanian socialism, looking very pleased with
himself as the crowd clapped mechanically. And then something went wrong. You can see it for
yourself on YouTube. Just search for ‘Ceauşescu’s last speech’, and watch history in action.20
The YouTube clip shows Ceauşescu starting another long sentence, saying, ‘I want to thank the
initiators and organisers of this great event in Bucharest, considering it as a—’, and then he falls
silent, his eyes open wide, and he freezes in disbelief. He never finished the sentence. You can see in
that split second how an entire world collapses. Somebody in the audience booed. People still argue
today who was the first person who dared to boo. And then another person booed, and another, and
another, and within a few seconds the masses began whistling, shouting abuse and calling out ‘Ti-mişoa-
ra! Ti-mi-şoa-ra!’
